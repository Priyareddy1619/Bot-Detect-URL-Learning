# Bot-Detect-URL-Learning
**Project Description:**

This project aims to develop a system for detecting malicious bots on Twitter using PySpark and machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers. With the proliferation of social media platforms like Twitter, the presence of malicious bots has become a significant concern due to their potential to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and engage in various forms of cyber attacks. Detecting and mitigating these bots are essential for maintaining the integrity and security of online communities.

**Technologies Used:**

- **PySpark:** PySpark is a Python API for Apache Spark, a powerful distributed computing framework. It enables scalable and efficient data processing, making it well-suited for handling large-scale datasets, such as those found on Twitter.
  
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Machine learning algorithms are employed to build predictive models that can automatically identify malicious bots based on various features extracted from Twitter data.
  
- **Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression is a popular classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks. In this project, it is utilized to classify Twitter accounts as either malicious bots or legitimate users based on their characteristics.
  
- **Naive Bayes:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for text classification tasks. In this project, Naive Bayes is applied to classify Twitter accounts as either malicious bots or legitimate users based on their textual content and behavioral patterns.

**Usage:**

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain Twitter data containing information about user profiles, tweets, engagement metrics, and other relevant attributes. This data serves as the input for training and testing the machine learning models.

2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the Twitter data to extract relevant features, handle missing values, perform text tokenization, normalization, and feature engineering tasks.

3. **Model Training:** Utilize PySpark's MLlib library to train Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers on the preprocessed Twitter data. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the models to the training data, and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. Fine-tune the models as needed to improve their effectiveness in detecting malicious bots.

5. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained models to production environments where they can be used to automatically detect and flag suspicious Twitter accounts in real-time. Integrate the detection system with existing security measures to mitigate the impact of malicious bot activities.
